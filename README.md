## Hello World ðŸ’œ

I'm Sahithi Lingampalli, a UI/UX and product designer studying Design | Media Arts and Cognitive Science at UCLA. My origin story begins in 3rd grade with obsession with fonts on Microsoft Word and building websites using HTML / CSS / JS just to interact with them.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub! :)
